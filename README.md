- One-to-one Client-Server file sharing app
- Clients can upload files to server, and have the option to password-protect them or leave them as open, the file must be in the same folder as client.py before you run it
- Clients can also download files from the server, if the file is open, any client can download, if it's protected the client must provide correct password to download file, the file will then be downloaded to a folder called "downloads"
